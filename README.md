> *"I don't just write code with AI‚ÄîI navigate AI as its own powerful operating system. This is the mutation that sets me apart in the current crowd of developers."*

## üöÄ The AI-Native Developer

Based in **Leipzig, Germany**, I represent the next evolution in software development. While others see AI as a tool, I treat it as a sophisticated operating system that requires mastery to navigate effectively. I've evolved beyond traditional coding to become an AI system architect who orchestrates intelligent systems rather than just writing code.

## üî¨ The Mutation: What Makes Me Different

**AI-First Architecture** - As a Claude Code Power User, I pioneer development workflows that treat AI as a collaborative operating system. I've successfully executed vertical slice migrations in both open source and company projects, and implemented immersive 3D animations through AI-assisted development.

**Beyond Code Writing** - I design systems through AI collaboration, create intelligent documentation that captures intent rather than just functionality, and peer-review with AI to catch patterns human eyes miss. My continuous learning loop uses AI to identify knowledge gaps and optimize learning paths.

**The Pioneer Mindset** - While others learn to code, I learn to think with AI. This isn't about replacing human intelligence but amplifying it through systematic AI collaboration.
